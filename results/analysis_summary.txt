DATASET & MODEL:
- Dataset: IMDB Movie Reviews (50,000 total)
- Model: Logistic Regression + TF-IDF (500 features)
- Model Accuracy: 84.16%
- Samples Analyzed: 20

KEY FINDINGS:
-------------

1. FEATURE AGREEMENT
   • Average Jaccard Similarity: 0.561 (56.1%)
   • Average Feature Overlap: 6.9 out of 10 features
   
   Interpretation: LIME and SHAP agree on approximately 56% of 
   important features, indicating reasonable consistency.

2. COMPUTATIONAL EFFICIENCY
   • LIME Average Time: 0.103 seconds per explanation
   • SHAP Average Time: 0.401 seconds per explanation
   • Speed Ratio: SHAP is 3.90x slower than LIME
   
   Recommendation: Use LIME for real-time applications, SHAP for detailed analysis.

3. PREDICTION QUALITY
   • Correctly Predicted: 17/20 (85.0%)
   • Average Confidence: 78.6%

4. MOST INFLUENTIAL FEATURES
   
   LIME Most Common: good, best, bit, don, know
   SHAP Most Common: great, best, worst, life, just
   
   Both methods successfully identify sentiment-bearing words.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
----------------
• Use LIME when: Speed is critical, quick debugging needed
• Use SHAP when: Consistency matters, formal reporting required
• Both methods are effective for sentiment analysis tasks

LIMITATIONS:
------------
• Limited sample size (N=20) due to time constraints
• Linear model only (Logistic Regression)
• Single domain (movie reviews)

Future work could expand to larger samples and deep learning models.
